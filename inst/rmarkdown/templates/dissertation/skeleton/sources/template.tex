%% This is a sample doctoral dissertation.  It shows the appropriate
%% structure for your dissertation.  It should handle most of the
%% strange requirements imposed by the Grad school; like the different
%% handling of titles of one/many appendices.  It will automatically
%% handle the linespacing changes.  The body default is double-spaced
%% (except when you use the singlespace or condensed options).  The
%% default for quotations is single-space, and the default for tabular
%% environments is also single-space.
%%
%% This class adds the following commands and environments to the
%% report class, upon which it is based:
%% Commands
%% ------------
%% \degree{name}{abbrv} -- Sets the name and abbreviation for the degree.
%%                         These default to ``Doctor of Philosopy''
%%                         and ``Ph.D.'', respectively.
%% \copyrightyear{year} -- for the copyright page.
%% \bachelors{degree}{institution} -- for the abstract
%% \masters{degree}{institution}   --  "
%%     if you have other degrees you may use
%% \secondbachelors{degree}{institution}
%% \thirdbachelors{degree}{institution}
%% \secondmasters{degree}{institution}
%% \thirdmasters{degree}{institution}
%% \priordoctorate{degree}{institution}
%%
%% \committeechair{name}           -- for the signature page
%% or, if you have two co-chairs:
%% \cochairs{first name}{second name}
%%
%% \firstreader{name}              --  "
%% \secondreader{name}             --  "
%% \thirdreader{name}              -- (optional)
%% \fourthreader{name}             --  "
%% \fifthreader{name}              --  "
%% \sixthreader{name}              --  "
%% \departmentchair{name}          -- for the signature page
%% \departmentname{name}           --  "
%%
%% \copyrightpage                  -- produces the copyright page
%% \signaturepage                  -- produces the signature page
%%
%% \frontmatter                    -- these are required in their various
%% \mainmatter                     -- appropriate locations
%% \backmatter                     --
%%
%% \unnumberedchapter[toc]{name}   -- like \chapter, except that it
%%                                    produces an unnumbered chapter;
%%                                    alternatively, like \chapter*,
%%                                    except that it lists the chapter
%%                                    in the table of contents.
%%
%% New environments:
%%   dedication  -- for the dedication
%%   abstract    -- for the abstract
%%
%% The thesis documentclass is built on top of the report document class.
%% It accepts all of the options that the report class accepts, plus the
%% following:
%%     doublespace -- the default, indicates double spacing as per U.Mass.
%%                    requirements.  You will need this when you do your
%%                    final copy.
%%     singlespace -- for earlier work, not acceptable to the Grad school
%%     condensed   -- for earlier work, not acceptable to the Grad school,
%%                    creates condensed versions of the frontmatter.
%%                    Condensed implies singlespace.
%%     dissertation - the default, indicates that this document is a
%%                    dissertation.
%%     proposal    -- indicates that this document is a dissertation proposal,
%%                    rather than a dissertation.  This will only change the
%%                    wording on the title and signature pages.
%%     thesis      -- indicates that this document is a Master's thesis
%%                    rather than a doctoral dissertation.  This also changes
%%                    the default for \degree to Master of Science, M.S.
%%     allowlisthypenation -- (the default), allows hyphenation of words in
%%                    the table of contents, the list of figures, and the list
%%                    of tables.  I believe that this is acceptable to the
%%                    Graduate School.
%%     nolisthyphenation -- disallows hyphenation of words in the table of
%%                    contents and the list of figures and tables.  Use this
%%                    option if the Grad School doesn't like your hyphenation.
%%     nicerdraft  -- relaxes some of the Grad School's rules for working with
%%                    drafts -- has no effect when doublespace is in effect
%%     nonicerdraft -- the default, leaves things in draft as they will be in
%%                     the final version
%% umassthesis changes the default font size to 12pt, but you may specify 10pt or
%%   11pt in the options.
\documentclass{umassthesis}          % for Ph.D. dissertation or proposal
% \documentclass[thesis]{umassthesis}  % for Master's thesis

%%
%% If you have enough figures or tables that you run out of space for their
%% numbers in the List of Tables or List of figures, you can use the following
%% command to adjust the space left for numbers.  The default is shown:
%%
%% \setlength{\tablenumberwidth}{2.3em}

%% Use the hyperref package if you're producing a version for online
%% distribution and you want hyperlinks.  Note that the Grad School doesn't want
%% their PDF viewers to colorize or otherwise highlight the links; use the
%% hidelinks option to hyperref to avoid decorating links.
%\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

%% One way of formatting the epigraph/frontispiece is to use this package.
%\usepackage{epigraph}
